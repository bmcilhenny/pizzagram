A machine learning app that uses Google's Neural Network API TensorFlow to train a machine to recognize what is pizza and what is not. After training our dataset with 500 images of what is pizza, users are now only able to upload images of pizza. The app also features a labeling game that will train the machine to recognize different toppings on pizza.
